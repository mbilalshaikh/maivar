## TODO List and ETA
- [x] Results on Kinect-400 (2022-11-04)
- [] Inference code and pretrained models (DS and OT) (2023)
- [] Code for reproducing the test-set results (2023)
- [] Webcam demo to reproduce the result shown in the GIF above (2023)
- [] Training code and training data preparation (expected 2023)

Discussions about the paper are welcomed in the [discussion panel](https://github.com/mbilalshaikh/maivar/discussions/).

:thinking: **FAQ**
- Distraction of audio from the background?
- Cleverness in fusion of different modalities?
